![komparo / Trajectory Differential Expression](docs/figures/logo.png)

**Disclaimer**: This repository is an attempt to create a workflow for continuous and collaborative benchmarking, applied on trajectory differential expression methods. It's still **a big work in progress**, and is currently only meant to explore the possibilities of such a benchmarking strategy. This is not a serious benchmark yet, but stay tuned!

![komparo / Trajectory Differential Expression](docs/figures/logo.png)

**Disclaimer**: This repository is an attempt to create a workflow for continuous and collaborative benchmarking, applied on trajectory differential expression methods. It's still **a big work in progress**, and is currently only meant to explore the possibilities of such a benchmarking strategy. This is not a serious benchmark yet, but stay tuned!

---

The benchmark has three main components:

- Common **file formats** for interchanging data
- **Modules** which generate datasets, run a method, evaluate the output, and generate a report
- **Benchmark workflow**, which runs the modules, validate their output, and ultimately generate a set of reports published at [tde.netlify.com](https://tde.netlify.com)

These different components are all discussed in the contributors guide: [komparo.github.io/tde](https://komparo.github.io/tde)

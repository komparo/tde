**Disclaimer**: This repository is an attempt to create a workflow for
continuous and collaborative benchmarking, applied on trajectory
differential expression methods. It’s still **a big work in progress**,
and is currently only meant to explore the possibilities of such a
benchmarking strategy. This is not a serious benchmark yet, but stay
tuned\!

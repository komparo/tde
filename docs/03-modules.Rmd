# Modules

A module can be anything that creates a predefined set of output files, optionally based on some input files. In this benchmark, we define four types of modules: dataset generators, methods, metrics and report generators. Each module type has common (but not necessarely exactly the same) input and output, which is discussed later in the [Module types] section.

A module is more than just code that generates some output. Each module is connected to a set of tools which make them portable, robust and reproducible:

## Code

## Portable environment: `r knitr::include_graphics("figures/logos/docker.png")`

## Metadata

The meta.yml file is a YAML file containing some essential metadata on the module. Two fields are required:

List of <span class="required">**authors**</span>, containing:

- <span class="required">**name**</span>
- <span class="required">**contributions**</span>: One or more values from the [CRediT taxonomy](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/author-contributions).
- <span class="required">**orcid**</span>: See [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/)
- <span class="optional">**github**</span>: Recommended
- <span class="optional">**mail**</span>: Recommended

The **license** of the code within the module (not including any packages or )

## Pipeline manager (certigo)

## Version control: `r knitr::include_graphics("figures/logos/git.png")`

## Code sharing: `r knitr::include_graphics("figures/logos/github.png")`

## Automated testing and continuous integration: `r knitr::include_graphics("figures/logos/travis.png")`

<div class="optional">
Add github pattern (so that devtools install github does not hit the request limits)

```bash
travis encrypt GITHUB_PAT=... --add env.global
```

</div>

## Environment registry: `r knitr::include_graphics("figures/logos/docker.png")`

To push the docker container to dockerhub, travis needs to know how to login.  dockerhub username and password (encrypted)

```bash
travis encrypt DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=... --add env.global
travis encrypt DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=... --add env.global
```
